Elevator/Lift Management System





Building -> List of Floors, ElevatorController

ElevatorController -> List of Elevators, List Of Buttons, Active Button To Elevator Queue

Elevator -> Current Floor, Direction, /*Weight*/, Active

Button -> UpDirection, DownDirection, FloorNumber

	2. Active or Inactive Lift

Non Functional Requirements:
	1. The sooner the better
	2. Optimizing time overall
	3. Scale this solution to more lifts
